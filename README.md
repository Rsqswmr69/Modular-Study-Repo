# Modular-Study-Repo
//Readme file
Here is where we will collaborate on the UMUC 495 Capstone Project.
//The idea is that a user can load different databases of quiz questions to study any desired topic.
//The program would also keep track of what score they achieved, when they achieved it, 
//and which database of questions they used to help //them track their studying progress.
