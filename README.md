 # Modular-Study-Repo
Here is where we will collaborate on the UMUC 495 Capstone Project. The idea is that a user can load different databases of quiz questions to study any desired topic. The program would also keep track of what score they achieved, when they achieved it, and which database of questions they used to help them track their studying progress.
